## Activity 1- How Fast?

### Apparatus:
- Toy battery powered car that travels at constant speed (alternatively have someone walk at a roughly constant pace)
- Stopwatch
- Meter stick
- Masking tape or whiteboard markers
- Copies of 2.1 Act 1 How Fast worksheet
- Copies of 2.2 Act 1 Number Line Speed
- Copies of WS2 Terms for How Far


### Pre-lab discussion
1. Observe a moving object, (ex, toy car, remote operated toy, or even a video clip of an object moving).  Ask yourself, “How do you know this object is moving?” 
1. Share some of your ideas with a partner.  Then share some of your ideas with the whole class the the Chat function and brainstorm.  
1. Now watch the battery operated vehicle run on the floor or table. How could we figure out this toy car’s speed?
1. Conduct a class brainstorm and record their ideas at the front of the room.

## Activity: How Fast?

1. Using the materials at hand, your task is to devise a method of determining how fast your car (or object) moves as confidently as possible. Create your plan on the large whiteboard. When it is aproved, write down your plan —what measurements do you need to take? What units will you use? Do you plan to take more than one set of data?

2. Carry out your plan from question 1 and record your data below. Remember to organize this data and add units as necessary to report back to the rest of the class. Take a picture of the whiteboard and post it to our gallery.

3. Do a digital galary walk and compare your results with the members of other groups. In the space below, describe at least two different methods used by groups to report “how fast”.

4. Whose car/person went the fastest? Is easy to compare? Why or why not?

5. The commonly accepted definition of speed is distance divided by time and the metric unit is the meters traveled by the object in 1 second (expressed with shorthand as m/s). Use google--------- to convert to meters per second.

6. Now again compare your results with the members of other groups. Is it easier to compare?
Explain.


### Post-lab discussion
Prepare a whiteboard to report the speed of their car (including units). Boards should show diagrams, graphs, and calculations to communicate how your group determined the speed of the toy car.
Conduct a circle whiteboarding session where all groups display their whiteboards at the same time. 
Now it’s time to ask questions of other groups. 
Have groups compare their results and data collection methods with the members of other groups. Whose car went the fastest? Is easier to compare? Why or why not?
Discuss your data collection methods.
